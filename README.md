# Internship Task 1 

Histogram of global population distribution (2024) using World Bank data.

This project focuses on visualizing the global population distribution using real-world data from the World Bank. The dataset contains total population figures for countries from 1960 to 2024. We selected the most recent year (2024) to analyze how populations vary across different countries.

A histogram was created to show the frequency distribution of population sizes, offering insights into population concentration and disparity among nations. The project demonstrates basic data handling, cleaning, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib, making it a perfect example of applying data science techniques to real data.
